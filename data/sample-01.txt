You are to implement the stages of finding textually similar documents based on Jaccard similarity using the shingling, minhashing, and locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques and corresponding algorithms. The implementation can be done using any big data processing framework, such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or no framework, e.g., in Java, Python, etc. To test and evaluate your implementation, write a program that uses your implementation to find similar documents in a corpus of 5-10 or more documents such as web pages or emails.

The stages should be implemented as a collection of classes, modules, functions or procedures depending the framework and the language of your choice. Below, we give a description of sample classes that implement different stages of finding textually similar documents.

For documents, see the datasets at the following link, or find other documents such as web pages or emails.
